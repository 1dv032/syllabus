## Examination 1 - Repetition and Cloud Computing

For this examination you are expected to produce a written report of between 800-1000 words. Report should be delivered to the course email address, 1dv032@lnu.se, as a **PDF, see the planing for exact date and time**.
Please note that the report should be written in Swedish or English. The report will go through a peer-review after finishing. This means you also should do a review of a other students paper. **Again, the report must be in pdf-format**

## Purpose of the report
The writing of this report aims to give knowledge of finding and analyzing services in one or more cloud service providers. In the report you will try to act as some kind of cloud advisor and try to analyze some scenarios and determine which kind of services will fit and motivate and explain your choices. The idea is not to get down to technical details rather to give an overview and explore the services that are available. There will be no direct and "correct" answers to this assignment but we are expecting that you do the job as good as you can and show us that you have put effort into your report.


### The scenario
You have been asked by a young software company to investigate their possibilities to bring their software into the cloud. Today they operate the application in a private datacenter where the configure up a couple of different servers. The software the company have develop is a software that will try to learn their customers speak and understand different languages through [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification). They have developed a web-based software for this purpose. The software includes not just the web site but also servers that handles calculation, static resources, caching and so on. The following image describes the system and how it looks today:

## Some tips
Spell check! Grammar check! Bad written reports will be failed!
Read it out loud. If it is hard for you to read, it is probably hard for someone else.
Let some else read it and get their feedback on the content, the language and the narrative.
Keep within the limits!

Make sure to make references to the course literature and any other articles that is relevant for your topic.

## The peer-review instructions
In this course we will use so-called peer-review, the Swedish also called "referensgranskning". This means in short that you will study an other studentÂ´s written reports. The idea of the step is to demonstrate your knowledge by analyzing and providing feedback on other student's assignments and hopefully also get great feedback on your own. This dose not mean that you should grade each other rather push and give each other good feedback. In addition, it is important to be able to rise from your own bubble and reflect on the work of others.

After the submission deadline, 25/9 0800, you will get an e-mail with another students report.
Read and analyze the report and give feedback, no more then 300 words
Send your feedback to the course email address and a copy to the student who wrote the report, no later than **27/9 08:00**.
