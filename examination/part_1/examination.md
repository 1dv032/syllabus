## Examination 1 - Repetition and Cloud Computing

For this examination you are expected to produce a written report of between 800-1000 words. Report should be delivered to the course email address, 1dv032@lnu.se, as a **PDF no later than 26/9 08:00.**
Please note that the report should be written in Swedish or English. The report will go through a peer-review after finishing. This means you also should do a review of a other students paper.

## Content of the report
The starting point for the report is the work already done for the seminar. At the seminar you presented your findings about cloud services. In the report you will act as an cloud advisor and try to analyze some scenarios and determine which kind of service will fit. You should consider pro and cons and make a good motivation of you choice.
Throughout the report you should use references to justify you findings, you can find more information about this at the [university library](https://lnu.se/en/library/Writing-and-referencing/referencing/) ([Swe](https://lnu.se/ub/skriva-och-referera/skriva-referenser/)).
### Part 1

**Scenarios** <br />
Three different software development companies have contacted you for a recommendation. All company have everything in-house of today but are considering moving into "the cloud". Your assignment is to provide one or more possible solution and motivate your recommendations:

**Company A** - An IT consultant company who is responsible for taking care of other companied IT solutions. They handling backup, security information, data processing  and so on.

The purpose of this part is to find relevant information and summarize it to your peers.

## Some tips
Spell check! And if possible grammar check!
Remember: this is a story even if the form is not that of a fairy tale or a novel. Think about your narrative and style!
Read it out loud. If it is hard for you to read, it is probably hard for someone else.
Let some else read it and get their feedback on the content, the language and the narrative.
Keep within the limits!

Make sure to make references to the course literature and any other articles that is relevant for your topic.

## The peer-review instructions
In this course we will use so-called peer-review, the Swedish also called "referensgranskning". This means in short that you will study an other studentÂ´s written reports. The idea of the step is to demonstrate your knowledge by analyzing and providing feedback on other student's assignments and hopefully also get great feedback on your own. This dose not mean that you should grade each other rather push and give each other good feedback. In addition, it is important to be able to rise from your own bubble and reflect on the work of others.

After the submission deadline, 26/9 0800, you will get an e-mail with another students report.
Read and analyze the report and give feedback, no more then 300 words
Send your feedback to the course email address and a copy to the student who wrote the report, no later than **28/9 08:00**.
