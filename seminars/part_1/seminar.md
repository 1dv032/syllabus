## Seminar
This seminar will concentrate on cloud services and focus from a ethical point view.
We will link to two different articles as a support for this seminar. This does not mean that you should depend only on these articles. You are expected to do some work by yourself by finding other articles, talks and facts that will support you in this assignment

### Questions

1. When you thinking about cloud computing. Could you argue for some positive aspects and some negative for a organization using cloud computing compering to a more traditional way (own data centers and so on). Could you come up with some future challenges for cloud providers or cloud consumers in the context of this seminar.

2. The cloud and the environment - How could a bigger use of cloud computing affect the environment? For the better or for the worse? How much electricity does a big cloud provider consume? Are there any examples of work done by these cloud providers to develop more energy-effective technology?

3. Cloud computing and the data - One of the biggest challenges of cloud computing is about handling the data. Which are the challenges about this and how could one strive to overcome them? What are the responsibilities?  

Try to think about this question from three different views 
* As a private person 
* As a developer of SaaS 
* As a cloud provider 

4. Find an article or some kind of case that you think is suitable to this seminar and that could be of interest for your class mates. Be prepared to explain your choses article/case in the seminar.

5. Privacy and personal integration - What do you think when someone tell you "Well I don´t care about that - I have nothing to hide!" when talking about privacy in the context of cloud computing and social media? Do you agree and say the same? Could it a problem to think so?
