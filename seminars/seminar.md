## Seminar
This seminar will concentrate on cloud computing and technology from an [ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) point view.
We will link to some different scientific articles to support you for this seminar but this does not mean that you are expected to find other articles.
The seminar examination is three-parted where the first part, the preparation, is the one that are expected to take the most time.

### Questions

1. As you understandable cloud computing technologies now is part of your day-to-day life. We often value it as what the services bring us and what they could offer us. In this part you should think about other aspects then the technical innovation. Below is a list of different contexts, some discussed in the articles, some not. There are questions to each context that will be the starting-point in the seminar discussions. 
**Find facts and summon your own opinion and arguments for both positive and negative aspects of cloud computing in regard to the following from an ethical viewpoint**

- Environment and sustainability
  * How could cloud computing help in this context?
  * Are there any issues with cloud computing in this context?
  * How could we gain a better use of could computing in the future?
- The rise of the artificial intelligence
  * How could cloud computing sustain the grows of AI technology?
  * 

2. Cloud computing and the data - Privacy and personal integrity
  * Who owns the data in the cloud? How could we decide this? What inflict does [GDPR](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataskyddsf%C3%B6rordningen) mean for cloud computing? 
  * What do you think when someone tell you "Well I do not care about digital privacy - I have nothing to hide!" when talking about privacy in the context of cloud computing and social media? Do you agree? Is it a problem to think so or will it easy up things like innovation and the development of technology? 


3. Find an article or some kind of case that you think is suitable to this seminar and that could be of interest for your class mates. Be prepared to explain your chosen article/case in the seminar.


### Examination
The seminar includes three parts and will be examined with Passed (P) and Fail(F). 

1. The first part is the preparation. You will write down your preparations you have done on each questions (with references to articles you used). This must be pushed to your course repository **deadline at noon (12:00) the day before the seminar. It must be in md- or pdf-format.** Keep it short but show us that you done your work. See it as your own main points to support you through the seminar. This is the most important part and you must be prepared to put some time and effort in this step...otherwise the seminar will fail.
 **If we do not found any preparation you is not allowed to attend the seminar.**
2. The second part is the seminar, the group discussion - You will be divided into groups and you are expected to be prepared and to be active in the discussions. The examinator will attend at the seminar but the discussions should be done by the students. **See your schedule for more information about when this is.**
3. The last part is the after-seminar report. After the seminar you should write down your reflections from the seminar and push these up to your repository. Did you learn something new during the seminar? Did you forgot to say something? Any other reflections? This should be pushed **at latest two days** after the seminar.

The grades will depend on your performance all this three steps. Have you prepared yourself? Were you active in the seminar? Did you have well reinforced arguments? How were your reflections? We will also take notes how well you perform (+ or -) in this three steps which could affect the final grade in this course.

This article take a deeper look at the issues that rises with cloud computing. The article is written by The Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS) which is a non-profit organization seeking to improve and promote a high standard among informatics professionals.

There are a few interesting talks about cloud computing available through [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/) and [TEDx Talks](https://www.ted.com/watch/tedx-talks)

### Re-examination
If you get the grade F or misses the seminar you will have an other opportunity. This will be at the end of the course.
