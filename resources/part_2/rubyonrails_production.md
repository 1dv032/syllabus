The Ruby on rails applications could be running with different enviroment flags. Development, test and production is the mot common one. In this text we should have a quick look on what to think about when running your Ruby on rails application in production.

# Install just the production gems
When developing we need gems that help us in teh developing process. Stuff like tests, debuging wonÂ´t be needed in the production server and we try to hold our applicatin as slim as possible. To ensure that you just install the "production gems" run the command `bundle install --without development test` that will exclude the test and development specific gems.

## Secrets
When you work as an developer you probably use some kind of version control system, maybe git and GitHub. When dealing with web applications you often have a secret string that will be used for hashing passwords, creating session-hashs and so on. This is a very sensitive string and should alwas be ignore in your repository so it will never be leaked to production. In production you should always have the secret as an enviroment variable (the rails application expects that as default). The easiest way to create a good secret-string is to run the command `rake secret` and update the enviroment needed (SECRET_KEY_BASE - look in config/secrets.yml)

## Migrate your database for production
Your database should be migrating so we run the options specified for our production demands. Maybe we have a other database manager then in development, we have probobly more security (user, usernames and passwords) and the production flag will probably do some optimizing when creating the database. You will find the configuration settings in "config/database.yml". To run your database commands make sure that the enviroment variable RAILS_ENV is set to production or run it when executing the command.
```
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
```
This will use the production settings.

## Static files and production
When running the application in production the framework will try to optimize the application in different ways. It will remove code running just running in dev or test, like some debug code. It will also optimize the static files, mainly the css and javascript. When developing you probably write your code in many small diffrent files but when puting them on the server you want to minify and combine these into lesser number of files (to save request to the server). The rails helps you with this (and will expect it when running in production). What you have to du is to precompile all your static files (or assets). This is done by this command:
```
rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
```
This will minify all css and javascript and compile if using SASS/LESS/Coffescript. The generated inks will also be rewritten and point to these files. Check the source code of the running application. Be sure to restart the application.
